# EpicJewels
This mod aims to add a bit more variance and options to Jewelcrafting. Filling in a lot of the current natural gaps.

Finally, the goal of this is to have fun!
One of the key pieces of that is feeling like you have options for the build you want, another is feeling like your choices _matter_ that you can choose a skill type or build design and use that to your advantage.
With this mod I hope to add a lot of basic elements to making a variety of new builds possible, and ideally, fun.
